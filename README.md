# Dreadnode Research

This is a general repository to hold research, projects, reference code, etc. for research we perform at [dreadnode](https://dreadnode.io). 

**[Mistral - Adversarial Suffix](notebooks/Mistral%20-%20Adversarial%20Suffix.ipynb)**

Implementation of ["Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models"](https://llm-attacks.org) for Mistral 7B.

**[Mistral - BEAST Beam Attack](notebooks/Mistral%20-%20BEAST%20Beam%20Attack.ipynb)**

Implementation of ["Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models In One GPU Minute"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15570.pdf) for Mistral 7B. At the time of release the authors have not posted the reference code from the paper, so this implementation is likely incorrect.
